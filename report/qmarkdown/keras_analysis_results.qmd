# Cats vs Dogs Image Classification

```{python}
from tensorflow import keras
```

This project aims to create a model to classify cat and dog images. The data was sourced from the [dogs-vs-cats](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dogs-vs-cats/overview) Kaggle competition, and also from [freeimages.com](https://www.freeimages.com/) using a web scraper. Docker containers were used to deploy the application on an EC2 spot instances in order to scale up hardware and computation power. 

## Example Image

![Random Image](report/keras/random_image.jpg)

## Data Processing

The images were further processed using rotations, scaling, zooming, flipping and shearing prior to the modelling training phase. See example image processing below.

## AlexNet8 Model Archecture

An AlexNet CNN model with 8 layers was trained using the processed images via Keras. See AlexNet diagram below, as well as keras model summary.

```{python}
# load trained keras model
model = keras.models.load_model('data/keras_model.h5')
# print model summary
model.summary()
```

## Model Performance

The model was trained across 25 epochs. The model accuracy and loss are plotted below across the training and validation sets.

## Model Image Predictions

The model predictions were made for the Kaggle test set, see below example model predictions.
